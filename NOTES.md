# Things I Learnt

* A WebArchive is just a binary plist.
* Apple has its own Epoch set to `2001-01-01T00:00:00Z`. A date is the number of **seconds** since this Epoch. (Contrary to JS where itâ€™s in milliseconds.)
* In JavaScript, you can convert a number to its binary or hex representation with `(1024).toString(2)` or `(1024).toString(16)`.
